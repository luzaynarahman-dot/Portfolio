★ Luzayna – Personal Portfolio Website:

A personal portfolio website built to showcase my front-end skills and personal style.

Since “Luzayna” translates to Silver, I designed this portfolio around a silver-inspired aesthetic reflecting clarity, refinement, and precision. It represents both my technical growth and my identity as a developer.

★ Built With:

HTML5 (Semantic structure)
CSS3 (Custom styling & layout design)
Responsive design principles

★ What I Learned:

Through this project, I strengthened:
Semantic HTML structuring
Layout organization
Design consistency
Personal branding through UI
Translating abstract identity into visual design
