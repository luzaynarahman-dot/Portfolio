★ Luzayna – Personal Portfolio Website:

A personal portfolio website built as part of a FreeCodeCamp (FCC) project requirement — but reimagined beyond the basic demo.
Instead of replicating the standard template, I chose to design something deeply personal. Since “Luzayna” translates to Silver, I built this portfolio around a silver-inspired aesthetic — reflecting clarity, refinement, and precision.
This project represents not just my technical progress, but my identity as a developer.

★ Built With:

HTML5 (Semantic structure)
CSS3 (Custom styling & layout design)
Responsive design principles

★ What I Learned:

Through this project, I strengthened:
Semantic HTML structuring
Layout organization
Design consistency
Personal branding through UI
Translating abstract identity into visual design
